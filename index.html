<h2> What is The Marvel Cinematic Universe? </h2>
<p>The Marvel Cinematic Universe is seperated from the old Comicbooks. I got some help on explaining it to you from the source Collider. 
The MCU is entierly what goes on in threaters and disney plus shows. The MCU order might confuse you on how to watch them so we created 
and more organized way of breaking the movies down from their release date. Marvel decided to organize there movies by "Phases". 
</p>


<h2>Phases</h2>
<p>So far there are Four Phases for the Marvel Cinematic Universe not organized by the time the movie took place but rather when the 
    movie came out to theaters</p>
